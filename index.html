    <h1>How do Earthquakes Happen?</h1>
    <p>An earthquake happens when two tectonic plates suddenly slip past each other, or in Afghanistan its where two plates collided. After an earthquake there will always be aftershocks, which are smaller earthquakes that happen after the mainshock. Aftershocks can continue for days, weeks, months or sometimes even years, it all depends on the size of the mainshock. When the edges of two plates get stuck together and the rest of the plate is still moving energy starts to build up, when the plates finally slip it releases all the stored energy in the form of and earthquake. </p>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The thrust type earthquake happened on the 31st of August 2025 at 23:47 local time (19:17 UTC), it was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake and IX (violent) on the Modified Mercalli intensity. There were about 3,000 deaths and 4,000 injuries, almost 8,000 homes collapsed. A vast majority of the casualties happened in five different districts in the Kunar Province, where most buildings were destroyed. It was the deadliest earthquake in Afghanistan since 1998. At least 890,000 people were exposed to violent shaking. Afghanistan is prone to earthquakes; it has had 6 earthquakes above 6.0 magnitude in the past 5 years. On September 2nd a magnitude 5.2 aftershock caused further damage, 5 more aftershocks happened on the evenings of the 4th and 5th of September causing 2 more deaths. </p>
    <p><b>Why do earthquakes happen in Afghanistan?</b>
      <br>
    Afghanistan is situated where to Indian Plate pushes into the Eurasian Plate, pressure from the plates colliding creates mountains and faults in the Earth’s crust, the quake was caused by the Indian plate pushing against and subducting under the Eurasian plate

    <h2>Effects</h2>
    <h2>Of the Earthquake</h2>
    <p><b>Short term effects:</b>
      <br>
A Taliban spokesperson said that the earthquake killed 2,217 people but the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that nearly 3,000 people had died and 4,000 had been injured. Around 8,000 homes were destroyed, and 441 villages saw the effects of the quake. Most of the affected homes were made of mud and stone, and most of the affected home were built on the sides of steep valleys increasing damage. 16 health centres were damaged, according to UNICEF around 1,182 of the fatalities were children. 53 schools were destroyed and 253 damaged. Many schools were unable to open on schedule affecting around 157,000 students. The destruction and high death toll were because the hypocentre (focus) was only 8km deep, and the ground below the epicentre was made of soft sediments. Heavy rain before the quake made the area at risk of landslides. 280 children had to be orphaned because of the quake, also more than 1.3 million animals were affected by the quake. The Norwegian Refugee Council said that around 7,000 livestock were killed, and seven irrigation systems were destroyed. The 5.2 magnitude aftershock on September 2nd caused landslides that blocked roads and slowed down rescue efforts.

<b>Long term effects:</b>
      <br>
The World Bank estimated the damage from the quake to be around 158 million euro, 97% of losses occurring in Nangarhar and Kunar Provinces, 35% of damage is residential buildings. Rebuilding all the damaged building will take very long and will cost a lot of money.

    <h2>Response to the Earthquake</h2>
    <p><b>Short term response: </b>
      <br>
    A few hours after the earthquake a Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said that local officials and volunteers had started rescue operations to provide aid to affected areas. Some areas also saw flash flooding that killed at least five people. The Taliban government gave 100 million Afghan afghanis (1.3 million Euro). Taliban authorities made a camp in Kunar to organise supplies and aid, more than 5,000 tents were put up and 72 temporary classrooms were made. Due to limited resources the Taliban asked for relief from international aid organisations. There were many volunteers in Nangarhar Province to donate blood for injured victims. Multiple victims had to be airlifted to Nangarhar Regional Hospital, the Afghan Air Force transported at least 2000 people across 441 flights. The flights also delivered around 23,100kg of aid. The Afghan Ministry of Defence transported 30 doctors and 800kg of medical supplies.

    <b>Long term response: </b>
      <br>
    Deploying seismic monitoring infrastructure will be key to preventing damage in future quakes, adding seismometers in seismically active areas such as Kabul and Herat can reinforce long-term monitoring efforts.

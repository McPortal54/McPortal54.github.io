    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The thrust type earthquake happened on the 31st of August 2025 at 23:47 local time (19:17 UTC), it was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake and IX (violent) on the Modified Mercalli intensity. There were about 3,000 deaths and 4,000 injuries, almost 8,000 homes collapsed. A vast majority of the casualties happened in five different districts in the Kunar Province, where most buildings were destroyed. It was the deadliest earthquake in Afghanistan since 1998. At least 890,000 people were exposed to violent shaking. Afghanistan is prone to earthquakes; it has had 6 earthquakes above 6.0 magnitude in the past 5 years. On September 2nd a magnitude 5.2 aftershock caused further damage, 5 more aftershocks happened on the evenings of the 4th and 5th of September causing 2 more deaths. </p>

    <h2>Effects</h2>
    <h2>Of the Earthquake</h2>
    <p>Short term effects:
A Taliban spokesperson said that the earthquake killed 2,217 people but the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that nearly 3,000 people had died and 4,000 had been injured. Around 8,000 homes were destroyed, and 441 villages saw the effects of the quake. Most of the affected homes were made of mud and stone, and most of the affected home were built on the sides of steep valleys increasing damage. 16 health centres were damaged, according to UNICEF around 1,182 of the fatalities were children. 53 schools were destroyed and 253 damaged. Many schools were unable to open on schedule affecting around 157,000 students. The destruction and high death toll were because the hypocentre (focus) was only 8km deep, and the ground below the epicentre was made of soft sediments. Heavy rain before the quake made the area at risk of landslides. 280 children had to be orphaned because of the quake, also more than 1.3 million animals were affected by the quake. The Norwegian Refugee Council said that around 7,000 livestock were killed, and seven irrigation systems were destroyed. The 5.2 magnitude aftershock on September 2nd caused landslides that blocked roads and slowed down rescue efforts. 
Long term effects: 
The World Bank estimated the damage from the quake to be around 158 million euro, 97% of losses occurring in Nangarhar and Kunar Provinces, 35% of damage is residential buildings. Rebuilding all the damaged building will take very long and will cost a lot of money.
